                <p>"Of Herbert West, who was my friend in college and in after life,
            I can speak only with extreme terror. This terror is not due altogether to the sinister manner of his recent disappearance, but was engendered by the whole nature of his life-work, and first gained its acute form more than seventeen years ago,
            when we were in the third year of our course at the Miskatonic
            University Medical School in Arkham. While he was with me, the wonder and
            diabolism of his experiments fascinated me utterly, and I was his closest
            companion. Now that he is gone and the spell is broken, the actual fear is
            greater. Memories and possibilities are ever more hideous than realities".
